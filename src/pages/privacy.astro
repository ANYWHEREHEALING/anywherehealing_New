      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="subtle"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> {effectiveDate} &nbsp;•&nbsp; <strong>Last Updated:</strong> {lastUpdated}</p>

      <p>
        {company} (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
        collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use our wearables, mobile
        applications, websites, and subscription services (collectively, the “Services”).
        By using our Services, you agree to this Policy.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Subscriber Disclosure:</strong> When you subscribe, we may collect and store subscriber
        data — including phone numbers, subscription status, and usage history — solely to
        deliver, maintain, and improve the Services. Review this full policy at
        <a href="/privacy/">anywherehealing.com/privacy</a>.
      </div>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> name, email, phone number, billing/shipping details.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> plan, renewal status, payment method (tokens handled by our processor), communication preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Therapy &amp; Device Data (with your consent):</strong> information from biosensors in the wearables, including frequency therapy sessions, duration, and usage patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Device &amp; Technical Data:</strong> device identifiers, OS/app version, Bluetooth connection logs, crash/performance data, IP address, and general location information derived from your IP or device settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage History:</strong> features accessed, timestamps, interactions, and similar analytics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Location Data</h2>
      <p>
        Our Services may collect location information in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>General Location:</strong> Collected from your IP address or device network settings to help us understand what region you are accessing the Services from.</li>
        <li><strong>Device-Based Location (if enabled):</strong> Some wearables or the mobile app may access Bluetooth or device location services to connect properly with your device and deliver therapies through biosensors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use this data to provide accurate device connectivity, improve service reliability,
        ensure regional compliance, and protect against fraud or misuse. Location information is not
        sold to third parties. You may disable location access in your device or app settings, though
        some features may not work correctly without it.
      </p>

      <h2>5. How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not sell</strong> your personal information.</p>

        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, consistent with this Policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> The above excludes text messaging originator opt-in data and consent;
        this information will not be shared with any third parties.
      </p>


      <h2>3. Phone Numbers & Subscription Updates</h2>

        have provided your phone number and consented to receive such messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        These reminders are intended to make it easier for you to complete your purchase and stay
        informed about items you expressed interest in. You can opt out of receiving SMS reminders at
