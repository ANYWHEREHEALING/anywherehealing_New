      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="subtle"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> {effectiveDate} &nbsp;•&nbsp; <strong>Last Updated:</strong> {lastUpdated}</p>

      <p>
        {company} (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
        collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use our devices, mobile
        applications, websites, and subscription services (collectively, the “Services”).
        By using our Services, you agree to this Policy.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Subscriber Disclosure:</strong> When you subscribe, we may collect and store subscriber
        data — including phone numbers, subscription status, and usage/viewing history — solely to
        deliver, maintain, and improve the Services. Review this full policy at
        <a href="/privacy/">anywherehealing.com/privacy</a>.
      </div>

        <li>Maintain security, debug, and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
        <li>Comply with applicable laws and enforce terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Legal Bases (EEA/UK only)</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Where GDPR applies, we rely on one or more of: your consent (Art. 6(1)(a)); contract
        performance (Art. 6(1)(b)); legitimate interests such as product improvement and security
        (Art. 6(1)(f)); and legal obligations (Art. 6(1)(c)). For health &amp; wellness data, we rely
        on your explicit consent where required (Art. 9(2)(a)).
      </p>

      <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not sell</strong> your personal information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> payment processors, secure cloud hosting, analytics, customer support tools — bound by contracts to use data only on our instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Practitioners:</strong> only if you explicitly authorize sharing your results.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal/Compliance:</strong> when required by law, to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, consistent with this Policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (e.g., encryption in transit,
        access controls, logging). No system is 100% secure, but we work to protect your data.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain data only as long as needed to provide the Services, comply with law, resolve
        disputes, and enforce agreements. You can request deletion as described below.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access/Portability:</strong> request a copy of your data.</li>

      <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        We may process data in the United States and other countries. Where required, we use
        appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Services are not intended for individuals under 18, and we do not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

      <h2>10. HIPAA Notice</h2>
      <p class="small">
        We are generally not a “covered entity” under HIPAA. However, when we partner with covered
        entities and sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA), HIPAA obligations apply to those
        integrations. Regardless, we apply strong safeguards to health &amp; wellness data you choose
        to store with us.
      </p>

      <h2>11. California Notice (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
      <p class="small">
        California residents have the right to know, access, correct, delete, and opt out of certain
        sharing. We do not sell personal information. To exercise your rights, email
        <a href={"mailto:" + contactEmail}> {contactEmail}</a>. If you use an authorized agent, we may
        request proof of authorization and verification.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies/SDKs for essential functionality, analytics, and performance. You can control
        cookies in your browser or system settings. See our separate <a href="/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a> for details.
      </p>
